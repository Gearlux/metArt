During the day, I make a living with IT and AI. But during my free hours, my hobby is to create things that excites people.

My passion is to create kinetic art. Kids, work and sport prevented that I spent a lot of time in this passion. 
Now that the kids are a little bit older, I try to re-animate this passion, assisted by the arrival of affordable 3D printers.

Unfortunately, the passion has a cost and in order not to jepardize my children's futures, metArt is my way to try to reduce the cost and justify my enormous amounts of 3D prototypes.

Hopefully, one day, I can make the kinetic art available for you.
